      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div id="about">
        <div>
          <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Celwyn Alexis B. Panis</strong>, I am from Mambajao, Camiguin, Philippines.
            I am 41 years old, born on August 7, 1984. I am happily married and have three children.
            I am a devoted husband and hands-on father.
            I cherish quality time with my children — whether at home or engaging in outdoor
            activities like fishing — and I find joy and fulfillment in being present
            for my family. 
          </p>
          
          <p>I am an Administrative Professional with extensive experience in government service, healthcare support, and community leadership.
            I’m passionate about serving others through efficient administrative work, technology-driven solutions, and compassionate support.
            For more than <strong>10 years</strong>, I have worked in various roles—ranging from Administrative Aide,
            Administrative Assistant III (City / Municipal Roving Bookkeeper), Project Development Officer, and volunteer church leader. I have served in
            institutions such as the <strong>Camiguin General Hospital, Department of Social Welfare and
            Development (DSWD)</strong>, and <strong>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</strong>, where I
            handled responsibilities in documentation, records management, financial coordination,
            people support, and community programs.

            <br><br>
            I am currently pursuing an <strong>Associate Degree in Software Development at Brigham Young
            University–Idaho</strong>, strengthening my skills in technology and preparing myself for modern,
            digital-driven administrative work. I also hold degrees in <strong>Human Resource Development
            and Management</strong> from <strong>Capitol University</strong> and Technology and Livelihood Education (Home Economics), along
            with training in Bookkeeping and Computer Technology.
            <br><br>
            
            Across all my experiences, I’ve grown into a reliable, detail-oriented, and service-focused
            individual who values integrity, teamwork, and continual learning. I aim to use my skills to
            contribute meaningfully to any organization I serve—combining administrative expertise,
            technical knowledge, and a sincere desire to help others.
          </p>
